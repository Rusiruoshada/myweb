					<p>You only need to tell us if you are concerned about checking your progress in the course and/or you want a free CS50 Certificate after you satisfy all of the requirements of the course. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can sign up for one at https://github.com/join. You can then use this account to log in to cs50.me/cs50t to track your progress in the course (your progress will only show up after you have received at least one score release email from CS50 Bot, so do be patient!). Don't worry about seeing a 'No Submissions' message on submit.cs50.io, if you find that. The course collects submissions using Google Forms, and only the gradebook on cs50.me/cs50t is important! If you do decide to provide us with a GitHub username, BE CERTAIN IT IS CORRECT. If you provide the wrong username, you will not be able to see your scores.
